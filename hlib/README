= HOW TO INSTALL
=================

The Haskell code relies on the following packages:

 - llvm-general (3.4.*.*)

The 'llvm-general' package requires LLVM 3.4 to be installed. LLVM *must* be
installed such that it can be invoked from any location or else the package will
fail to be installed. (I've tried to keep LLVM in the home directory, but no
matter which flags I set to Cabal the package will just refuse to recognize that
the correct version of LLVM is installed.)

To install LLVM 3.4, run the following commands:

   svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_34/final llvm
   cd llvm/tools
   svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_34/final clang
   cd ../..
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../llvm/configure --enable-shared
   make
   sudo make install

To install 'llvm-general', run the following commands:

   sudo cabal install llvm-general
