= HOW TO BUILD
===============

You will first need to install several Haskell packages using Cabal. To keep the
installation clean and avoid conflicts with other Haskell packages, 'cabal
sandbox' can be used (supported starting from version 1.18 of Cabal) as
follows. Before installing the packages, run (from the directory where the
README is located):

   cabal sandbox init   (first time only)

   cabal exec bash      (creates a new environment where ghc and all the other
                         Haskell tools are also sandboxed)

The packages to be installed are:

 - aeson
 - atto-lisp
 - clock
 - cmdargs
 - fgl
 - llvm-general-3.4
 - graphviz
 - safe
 - shelly
 - split

To install a Haskell package with Cabal, run the following commands:

   cabal install <package>

Now you will need to build the toolchain, which is done by running the following
commands from the folder where this file is located:

   make

You also need to install MiniZinc 2.0, if it is not already installed.
