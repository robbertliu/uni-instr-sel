= HOW TO BUILD
===============

First, LLVM 3.4 needs to be installed on the machine. LLVM *must* be installed
such that it can be invoked from any location or else a necessary Haskell
package will fail to be installed. (I've tried to keep LLVM in the home
directory, but no matter which flags I set to Cabal the package will just refuse
to recognize that the correct version of LLVM is installed.)

To download and install LLVM 3.4, run the following commands:

   svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_34/final llvm
   cd llvm/tools
   svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_34/final clang
   cd ../..
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../llvm/configure --enable-shared --enable-optimized
   make
   sudo make install

The last command installs the LLVM binaries in /usr/local.

Next you will need to install several Haskell packages using Cabal:

 - aeson
 - atto-lisp
 - cmdargs
 - graphviz
 - llvm-general-3.4.4.2   (Take note of the explicit version!)
 - safe
 - shelly
 - split

To install a Haskell package with Cabal, run the following commands:

   sudo cabal install <package>

Now you will need to build the toolchain, which is done by running the following
commands from the folder where this file is located:

   make

You also need to install MiniZinc 2.0, if it is not already installed.
